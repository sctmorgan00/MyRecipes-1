## Eggnog Custard Tart

#### Makes 1 (9-inch) tart
Ingredients

    Browned Butter (recipe follows), softened
    ⅓ cup (40 grams) confectioners’ sugar
    ¾ teaspoon (3 grams) vanilla extract*
    ½ teaspoon (1.5 grams) kosher salt
    1½ cups (188 grams) all-purpose flour
    Eggnog Custard Filling (recipe follows)
    Grated fresh nutmeg and grated fresh cinnamon, for dusting
    Garnish: white chocolate curls (see Note)

The Whipped Cream
    1 cup cold heavy whipping cream
    1/2 cup powdered sugar
    1/2 tsp vanilla extract
    ground cinnamon for dusting optional

Instructions

   1.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat Browned Butter at low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and salt, beating until combined, stopping to scrape sides of bowl. Gradually add flour, beating until combined and dough comes together, 3 to 4 minutes.
   2.  Press dough into a 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Gently press dough into bottom and up sides of pan until smooth and even. Freeze for 30 minutes.
   3.  Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
   4.  Remove tart pan from freezer. Place tart pan on prepared baking sheet.
   5.  Bake until light golden brown around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. While crust is still warm, gently flatten any puffed areas with the back of a spoon. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
   6.  Pour warm Eggnog Custard Filling into prepared crust. Generously dust with nutmeg and cinnamon.
   7.  Bake until set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in center, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. Garnish with white chocolate curls, if desired. This tart is best enjoyed the day it is baked.

### Browned Butter
 
Makes ¾ cup Custard Tart
Ingredients

    ¾ cup (170 grams) unsalted butter

Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until butter turns a medium-brown color and has a nutty aroma, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer to a small bowl; let cool completely. Refrigerate until ready to use.

### Eggnog Custard Filling
 
Makes 2 cups
Ingredients

    1 cup (240 grams) half-and-half
    ½ cup (120 grams) whole milk
    1 tablespoon (15 grams) dark spiced rum
    2 teaspoons (8 grams) vanilla extract*
    6 large egg yolks (112 grams)
    ⅓ cup (67 grams) castor sugar (see Note)

Instructions

   1.  In a medium saucepan, heat half-and-half, milk, rum, and vanilla over medium heat, stirring frequently, just until bubbles form around edges of pan. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat.
   2.  In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar. Slowly pour in hot milk mixture, whisking constantly. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve. Use immediately.

### The Whipped Cream Topping

The next day before serving, create the whipped cream by whisking the heavy cream on high speed until indentations begin to form. Add the vanilla extract and give it a whisk to combine. Add the powdered sugar, and continue to whisk on high speed until you get a thick, frosting-like consistency.
Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip with the whipped cream. Pipe the whipped cream onto the top of each tart, then dust with cinnamon.***
